# Index patterns

You can use index patterns to search, analyze, and visualize your data. An _index pattern_ is a way to define which data to use and how to interact with it. It can point to one or more indexes, data streams, or index aliases. For example, an index pattern can point you to your log data from yesterday or all indexes that contain your data. Index patterns allow you to define field properties and customize how the data is displayed in OpenSearch Dashboards.

To create or modify index patterns, you must have write permissions. For more information, refer to [Multi-tenancy configuration]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/security/multi-tenancy/multi-tenancy-config/#give-roles-access-to-tenants).
